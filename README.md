# spinning-loader
Demonstrates how to create a spinning loader using html and css.

### The HTML
The page starts with a wrapper to center and shape the content area.

Inside the wrapper there are two main elements:
- the loader div, which contains the spinning circles.
- the header tag, which has some static text and the animated dots.

The HTML file is commented to make identifying the different elements more easily.

### The CSS
The first series of styles are generic and not important for the actual demo.

The three dots are animated with plain css3, no need for scripting.

The loader is styled using both :before and :after and is also animated with css3.

The CSS file is heavily commented to explain the different rules.
